This project allows you to do 2 different things:


1- Calculation of SM predictions for Flavour Observables. For this first of all it is recomputed the CKM matrix based on Bjorken-Dunietz parametrization (unitary). The Flavour Observables included for the moment are
\DeltaM_{s,d}, B{s,d}->mumu, Bs->Xsll, B->\tau\nu, Bs->Xs\Gamma, K->\pi\nu\nu, K->\mu\nu 


2- CUDA Sampling of NMFV MSSM (using MI´s approximation).
